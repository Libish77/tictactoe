Hi everyone,
I'd be glad to provide a comprehensive description for a beginner's Tic-Tac-Toe game using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** on GitHub:

Tic-Tac-Toe: A Beginner's Web Game Project

This repository guides you through building a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using fundamental web development technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

What You'll Learn:

HTML Structure: Create the basic layout of the game board using HTML elements.
CSS Styling: Apply styles to customize the appearance of your game board and individual cells.
JavaScript Logic: Implement core game mechanics like turn tracking, cell selection, win conditions, and tie detection using JavaScript.
Event Handling: Respond to user interactions (clicks) on the game board cells.
Getting Started:

Clone the Repository: Use Git to clone this repository to your local machine.

Open in a Code Editor: Open the project files in your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom).

Explore the Code: Each file serves a specific purpose:

index.html: Contains the HTML structure of the game board.
style.css: Defines the visual styles for the game elements.
script.js: Implements the game logic and functionality.
Run the Game: Open index.html in your web browser to launch the game.

How to Play:

Click on a cell to place your mark (X or O).
The game will alternate turns between players.
Aim to get three of your marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to win.
If all cells are filled without a winner, it's a tie.

Challenge Yourself:

Add a feature to reset the game and start over.
Enhance the visual design of the game board using CSS.
Implement difficulty levels by introducing an AI opponent.
Feel free to:

Experiment with different layouts and designs.
Add sound effects for clicks or winning conditions.
Explore browser developer tools to inspect and modify the behavior of your game.
